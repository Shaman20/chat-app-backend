# This is the chat app backend

- Nodejs version v18.17.1
- Do `npm start` to start the application
- If you want to run the application in a different port change the port number in the ".env" file

- Just implemented JWT authentication and a friend request feature in my Node.js backend for a chat app using MariaDB. 💻
- Now, user authentication is seamless with JWT, and the friend request feature is ready to roll! 🤝
